## Methods and Techniques Used

1. **Alignment of Input and Template** 
- *Get the image clicked by the user , allighn the image to the reference image of the same form stored in our database*

|Image Title|Image Preview|
|-----------|-------------|
|Input Image|<img src="image.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="300" height="300">|
|Template Image|<img src="template.jpeg" alt="Template Image" width="300" height="300">|

- To do this:
    - I first find ORB features and descriptors in both the images
    - Then I match those features to compute homography matrix

    <img src="matches.jpg" alt="Input Image" width="300" height="200">

    - After computing the homography matrix I apply that on the Input Image to allighn it to template Image.

2. **Extract ROI(Region of Interest)**
- *Extract the ROI from the input image , based on the previously defined co-ordinates for the case of template Images*

- To do this:
    - I first manually measure the co-ordinates of the ROI's in template image (I have to only do this one time for a type of form)
    - Then I extract the ROI's from the already **alligned** input image

3. **OCR on ROI's**
- *Get the ROI's from the previous step and apply preprocessing and pass it to customly configured Tesseract OCR to get the output*

- To do this:
    - I first apply thresholding to the ROI's and then sharpening and Non-Linear Denoising to get the optimum output from OCR.
    - We then pass to the Tesseract OCR which uses an LSTM Model to get the output of the given input image.

- Output
    - Email :<img src="email.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="200" height="25"> : MADAN MANANI
    - Contact Number :<img src="contact-number.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="206" height="24"> :9963005624
    - First Name : <img src="first-name.jpeg" alt="Input Image" width="162" height="21"> : RISHIMâ€™ BMADAN

- There are some error's but for the most part it is working satisfactorily!
## Model:
- Tesseract's OCR uses an SOTA LSTM Model to classify the given image
- It makes sense to use Sequence Model over CNN as the given image is a sequence and we can exploit temporal relation b/w the sequence in the image.
